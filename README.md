# Google-Play-Store-Apps
Web scraped data of 10k Play Store apps for analysing the Android market.

## Final Capstone for the 30-Day Challenge by [Zindua School](https://zinduaschool.com)

### The Data for this challenge was sources from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps/download?datasetVersionNumber=6)

## Context

While many public datasets (on Kaggle and the like) provide Apple App Store data, there are not many counterpart datasets available for Google Play Store apps anywhere on the web. On digging deeper, I found out that iTunes App Store page deploys a nicely indexed appendix-like structure to allow for simple and easy web scraping. On the other hand, Google Play Store uses sophisticated modern-day techniques (like dynamic page load) using JQuery making scraping more challenging.

Each app (row) has values for catergory, rating, size, and more.

 ## Deliverables 
The following are the outcomes expected from the project: 
1. Create a logical and physical SQL Schema - Have it separate and upload it to your GitHub repo
2. Create the the Databases and the tables to contain the data 
3. Load the data to Power BI and Perform transformations - e.g cleaning the age column, formatting datatypes 
4. Develop Power BI Visualizations 
5. Develop a Power BI - Dashboard 
6. Presentation with Insights.
